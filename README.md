# OmniWebOS
OmniWebOS is an open-source initiative to create a unified platform that merges the functionalities of an operating system and a web browser. This ambitious project aims to replace traditional operating systems by providing a seamless, integrated environment where users can run web applications, play games, and use heavy software efficiently.
